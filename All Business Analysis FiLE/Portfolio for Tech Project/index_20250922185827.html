										<h2><a href="#">Using SQL and Power BI to Create an Interactive Dashboard<br />
									</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Data Analyst Codig Picture 3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>At a logistics company, upper management struggled with visibility into delivery performance across regions. Reports were coming in late, manually compiled in Excel, and very much inconsistenT. Executives wanted to make faster decisions, but had no real-time data to support them.
                                     After interviewing stakeholders, I discovered that the company had a wealth of delivery and driver data stored in a SQL Server database, but no one was using it effectively. I took over the project, and wrote optimized SQL queries to extract key metrics like on-time delivery rate, average delivery duration, and driver performance by route.
                                     I then connected Power BI to the SQL database, using scheduled refreshes to ensure up to date data. Within two weeks, using SQL and PowerBi,  I had built an interactive dashboard with filters for region, driver, date range, and vehicle type. It included KPIs, heatmaps, and trend lines that could be used for insights.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Analysing Customer Behaviour<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Data Analyst Coding Picture 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> I once worked on a dataset that was a beautiful chaos: columns everywhere, missing values, and there was no clear narratives. My task was to help senior management to identify customer behavior in that industry. But that's where the beautlm,ly begins.I opened Power BI, and what started as raw numbers became an interactive dashboard of insights. Each filter I added and every DAX formula I adjusted brought me closer to a bigger picture. Using the model view picture gave me a clear picture of the relationship between the different dimension tables I had to work with.  
                                      The end result? A visualization that communicated a narrative which numbers wouldn't convey: trends, opportunities, and outliers all in one visualization. What I appreciate about Power BI is the simple ability to visualize data, but it is more about the ability to allow people to think differently about their business to ask better questions to make better decisions relating to their marketing campaigns.
