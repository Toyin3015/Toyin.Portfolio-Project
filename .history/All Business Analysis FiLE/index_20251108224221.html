									<h2><a href="#">SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE: FROM FRAGMENTED TO UNIFIED</a></h2>
									<p>Headquartered in Santorini, Greece, Zara Escapes operates 20 beachfront properties renowned for exceptional service and eco-conscious hospitality. Despite strong performance, fragmented feedback channels limit our ability to respond swiftly and improve proactively.
                                      At the end, we Implemented a Centralized Customer Feedback System integrating data from 20 properties into a unified Power BI dashboard for real-time sentiment tracking and service insights.

										<h2><a href="#">Using SQL and Power BI to Create an Interactive Dashboard<br />
									</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Data Analyst Codig Picture 3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>At a logistics company, upper management struggled with visibility into delivery performance across regions. Reports were coming in late, manually compiled in Excel, and very much inconsistenT. Executives wanted to make faster decisions, but had no real-time data to support them.
                                     After interviewing stakeholders, I discovered that the company had a wealth of delivery and driver data stored in a SQL Server database, but no one was using it effectively. I took over the project, and wrote optimized SQL queries to extract key metrics like on-time delivery rate, average delivery duration, and driver performance by route.
                                     I then connected Power BI to the SQL database, using scheduled refreshes to ensure up to date data. Within two weeks, using SQL and PowerBi,  I had built an interactive dashboard with filters for region, driver, date range, and vehicle type. It included KPIs, heatmaps, and trend lines that could be used for insights.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Analysing Customer Behaviour<br /></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Data Analyst Coding Picture 2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p> I once worked on a dataset that was a beautiful chaos: columns everywhere, missing values, and there was no clear narratives. My task was to help senior management to identify customer behavior in that industry. But that's where the beautlm,ly begins.I opened Power BI, and what started as raw numbers became an interactive dashboard of insights. Each filter I added and every DAX formula I adjusted brought me closer to a bigger picture. Using the model view picture gave me a clear picture of the relationship between the different dimension tables I had to work with.  
                                      The end result? A visualization that communicated a narrative which numbers wouldn't convey: trends, opportunities, and outliers all in one visualization. What I appreciate about Power BI is the simple ability to visualize data, but it is more about the ability to allow people to think differently about their business to ask better questions to make better decisions relating to their marketing campaigns.

										<h2><a href="#">COLLABORATIVE TOOLS, A BUSINESS ANALYST GAME CHANGER.<br/></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/JIRA S.png"alt="" /></a>
									<p>Before tools like Confluence, Jira, google sheet and other collaborative tools, so much of a Business Analyst’s work lived on paper work, documents and long email threads. Now, collaboration feels alive. I can sit with stakeholders (virtually or in person) and co-create mapping processes, refining requirements, and visualizing solutions together in real time.
                                      This is such a big deal for me. It’s no longer my document or their feedback. It’s our shared understanding. Sharing your contribution real time regardless of your location. 
                                      When everyone can see the “why” and contribute to the “how,” ownership and engagement go way up. Everybody on the team becomes united on one common goal. No more silos.
                                      With such wonderful tools, your output can only get better. If you ain't using any of these tools, maybe it's time to do your research; there is a collaborative tool fit for every organization no matter the kind of work you do. 								</p>

									<p>Every successful system rollout starts with a roadmap. Without it, alignment is lost, and delivery suffers. As a Business Analyst, one of my key responsibilities is to bridge the gap between business needs and technical execution. A clear and structured roadmap ensures alignment across all stakeholders, while also setting realistic expectations for delivery.

										<h2><a href="#">The Power of SQL and Power BI <br/></a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/Data Analyst coding pictures.jpg"alt=All Business Analysis FILE /></a>
									<p>As a business analyst, I’ve learned that behind every number, there's a story, and this one really stood out. I recently analyzed some sales data using Power BI, and a few key insights stood out. Over €1.13M in revenue from 700+ orders, not bad. However, upon closer examination, I identified significant opportunities for growth. I noticed the seasonal trends, otp products, hidden gaps,customer segmentation and behaviour.
										These insights can be used to boost revenue in slower quarters, improve product performance, and tailor customer engagement. My take home in this project, These insights can be used to boost revenue in slower quarters, improve product performance, and tailor customer engagement
